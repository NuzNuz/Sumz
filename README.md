# SwiftSum

SwiftSum is a cutting-edge web application that leverages the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-4 AI to summarize articles at the click of a button. All you need to do is provide a link to the article, and SwiftSum will generate a concise, comprehensive summary for you. SwiftSum is built with modern technologies like React.js and Tailwind CSS and makes use of the RapidAPI platform for connecting to the OpenAI GPT-4 API.

## How To Use

1. Enter the URL of the article in the input field
2. Click on "Summarize"
3. Wait for a few seconds as SwiftSum generates a summary of the article*
4. Read the generated summary

*Depending on the structure of the article, SwiftSum sometimes fails to access the content and therefore will not summarize. I am looking for a solution to this, but please feel free to try another article
Also, I am using a free version of the API, where I am restricted to 50 calls per month. This may also cause the application to fail if the maximum calls are met.
